This is my remake of the popular command line game "Drug Wars" in the Godot game engine with a more "G" rated premise!
You are a farmer engaged in arbitrage. Your goal is to grow crops in cheap cities and sell them in expensive cities!
Be careful though, as you can crash your van, your food can rot, and multiple other events can cause you to lose crops!
Pay off your bank loan and stack up as much money as you can before one month passes! (Each turn is one day)

I created this as a minigame inside of a game. Feel free to use the terrible code, or the entire game itself.
I do ask that you give credit to me if you use a large percentage of my work, especially if you copy/paste the game.
Other than that, feel free to use this game and source code as you please!

(Many of these functions are not implemented in the current state, the game is however playable in a basic state)
